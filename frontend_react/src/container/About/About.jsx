      <p> With over four years of experience in programming through 
      courses and hackathon projects, I bring a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, 
      data structures, 
      and algorithms. After being fascinated by how my dadâ€™s Tesla detected other vehicles, 
      pedestrians, and objects around us, I completed the course Neural Networks and Deep 
      Learning from deeplearning.ai where I applied my calculus and linear algebra knowledge 
      to writing algorithms to recognize various objects. I am currently learning TensorFlow.js 
      and React Native to create an app with image classification that will incentivize users to 
      take pictures of trash they pick up in their communities for rewards. I am also a member 
      of Robotics at Maryland where I am learning how to program a Raspberry Pi to control a 
      catamaran through their onboarding program.
