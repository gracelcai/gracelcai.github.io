# General Micro-Mobility Model

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of micro-mobility vehicles (MMV) is
becoming increasingly important for training autonomous
vehicle systems and building urban traffic simulations.
However, mainstream tools rely on variants of the Kinematic
Bicycle Model (KBM) or mode-specific physics that miss tire
slip, load transfer, and rider/vehicle lean. To our
knowledge, no unified, physics-based model captures these
dynamics across the full range of common MMVs and wheel
layouts. We propose the “Generalized Micro-mobility Model”
(GM3), a tire-level formulation based on the tire brush
representation that supports arbitrary wheel
configurations, including single/double track and
multi-wheel platforms. We introduce an interactive
model-agnostic simulation framework that decouples
vehicle/layout specification from dynamics to compare the
GM3 with the KBM and other models, consisting of fixed step
RK4 integration, human-in-the-loop and scripted control,
real-time trajectory traces and logging for analysis. We
also empirically validate the GM3 on the Stanford Drone
Dataset’s deathCircle (roundabout) scene for biker, skater,
and cart classes.
