# Weapon Watch
I am leading a team of ten students from various disciplines (including CS, Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Business, Finance) to compete in [xFoundry@UMD](https://www.xfoundry.umd.edu/)'s school safety startup competition. As team lead, I facilitate meetings, delegate tasks, and manage the project. While I work on all technical aspects of our product, I am primarily focused on suspect detection, re-identification, and tracking.

I am currently setting up a website to showcase our work and achievements so far. Until then, feel free to check out the code for our [app](https://github.com/gracelcai/weapon-watch-app/tree/main) and [detection system](https://github.com/chrissu777/weapon-watch-cameras/tree/main).
