# Weapon Watch
From October 2024 to September 2025, I led a team of ten students from various disciplines (including CS, Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Business, Finance) to compete in [xFoundry@UMD](https://www.xfoundry.umd.edu/)'s school safety startup competition in which our team was a finalist (top 2/24). As team lead, I facilitated meetings, delegated tasks, and managed the project. While I worked on all technical aspects of our product, I primarily focused on suspect detection, re-identification, and tracking with PyTorch. I also set up an Nvidia RTX 5070 to use CUDA for weapon detection and tracking.

Feel free to check out the code for our [app](https://github.com/gracelcai/weapon-watch-app/tree/main) and [detection system](https://github.com/chrissu777/weapon-watch-cameras/tree/main).
