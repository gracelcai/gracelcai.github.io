# Hello, I'm Grace!
I am a Computer Science and Physics double major at the University of Maryland, College Park. My interests include machine learning, computer vision, and physics-based simulation. I have two summers of experience at Uber as a Software Engineering Intern on the Technical Privacy Team. Additionally, I am leading a team of ten students to compete in [xFoundry@UMD](https://www.xfoundry.umd.edu/)'s school safety startup competition and I am the computer vision lead for Robotics at Maryland's autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), Qubo. In my free time, I enjoy playing golf and baking.
