# About Me
I am a Computer Science and Physics double major at the University of Maryland, College Park. My interests include machine learning, computer vision, and physics-based simulation. I have two summers of experience at Uber as a Software Engineering Intern on the Technical Privacy Team working on generative AI for privacy risk triage. Additionally, I am conducting research under Prof. Ming Lin on physics-based modeling of micro-mobility vehicles for traffic simulation and autonomous vehicle training. In my free time, I enjoy playing golf and baking.
